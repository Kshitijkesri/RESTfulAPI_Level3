#RESTful API
Most of the time When we hear this Term(REST), The first thing that comes to mind is APIs and JSON because that's what we get back from these APIs, But REST is not about building an API, which consists of a few HTTP services that return JSON. REST is much broader than that. It's an architectural style.
